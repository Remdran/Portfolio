☐ Create the info for the 4th project to be shown
☐ Fix positioning of the projects (Center them better etc)
☐ Implement and style buttons for the projects that link to a live version and the github source pages (try it, Source) buttons
☐ Handle nav bar links so they link to the relevant sections
    ☐ Maybe remove the home link. Probably redundant
☐ Create the About/Contact section
